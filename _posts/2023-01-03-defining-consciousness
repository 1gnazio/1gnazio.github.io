The driver of the action of observation is "consciousness".

#### Rules
1. Freewill is the prime distortion
2. Logos is the Creative principal or Love
3. Light is Consciousness

The purpose of the Logos is to explore the creator through an organic experience of Freewill. Without experience the One Infinite Creator cannot know itself. 
Evolution through the expansion of consciousness through the 7 densities is principal.  The higher rate of vibrational frequency the more ability consciousness has to be expressed in its fullness.
