#### How I Work
It is not uncommon for astrologers to incorporate multiple astrological systems in their practice, including both the I Ching and Western astrology. 

The I Ching, also known as the Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text that is often used to gain insight into the future and make decisions. 

Western astrology, on the other hand, is a system that originated in the Hellenistic world and is based on the belief that the positions and movements of celestial bodies can influence human affairs and natural phenomena.

Some astrologers believe that combining the two systems can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of an individual's life path.

 The I Ching can offer insight into an individual's spiritual path and the energies and forces at play in their life, while Western astrology can provide more concrete information about the individual's personality traits and potential challenges and opportunities. By combining the two systems, astrologers may be able to gain a deeper understanding of an individual's divine life path and offer guidance and support on their journey.
