The Anunnaki God - Ningshiidza allegedly took on the role of Egyptian God Thoth creating civilizations replete with monuments and artifacts depicting their alleged time on Earth. Thoth allegedly flew across the planet founding the Mesoamerican Civilization where he became known as Quetzalcoatl.
Pantheons of gods and goddesses were all played by the same "character" throughout mythology following the same algorithm. They came from the sky - stayed to seed the human race - then left to return one day at the end of the cycle called time. They wore masks and costumes - left behind artifacts, calendars and landmarks and most importantly encoded message within human DNA to be activated when Time ran out. By any name they were our progenitors.
Quetzalcoatl is depicted in many ways usually as the feathered serpent though sometimes as a - Shining One - looking nothing like the Mesoamerican people who worshipped him. Feathers represent the ascension of human consciousness back to its origins - while 'serpent' represents human DNA in physical reality.
Other stops along the way in the matrix of experiences on planet Earth - included the ancient civilizations of Asia, Africa, North America, and other parts of the world that no longer exist today - many sunk due to cataclysmic changes. They are all part of the simulation in the story of humanity in the bipolar (physical) realms of The Human Experiment. It's all just a story set in linear time to experience emotions with gods who will never return as the story Fades to Black when Time runs out.

#### Dragon Archetype
The Dragon archetype is a universal symbol that appears in many different cultures and mythologies around the world. It is often associated with power, wisdom, and hidden knowledge, as well as with destructive forces such as fire and chaos.

In Mesoamerican mythology, the Quetzalcoatl deity is often depicted as a dragon or serpent, and is revered as a creator god and patron of the arts, science, and knowledge. According to Aztec mythology, Quetzalcoatl was the god of wind and learning, and was also associated with Venus, the morning star. 

He was believed to be the creator of humanity, and was revered as a wise and just ruler.

The Dragon archetype and the Quetzalcoatl deity are both symbols of power, wisdom, and knowledge, and are often seen as representing the duality of these qualities, as both can be used for good or for evil. They are also often associated with transformation and the overcoming of obstacles, as the dragon is often depicted as a formidable opponent that must be conquered in order to achieve success.

In this sense, the Dragon archetype and the Quetzalcoatl deity can be seen as representing the challenges and struggles that we all must face in life, and the wisdom and strength that we must draw upon in order to overcome them.
